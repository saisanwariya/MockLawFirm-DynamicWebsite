            <h3>Litigation</h3>
            <div class="red-bar"></div>
            
            <p>Pearson Spector Litt has the most formidable plaintiffs’-side practices in the world. The caliber of our legal talent, the resources we can bring to all aspects of the case, and our proven track record on the plaintiffs’-side are second to none.</p>
            <p>When representing plaintiffs, our lawyers have won $60 billion in judgments and settlements. We have also obtained five 9-figure jury verdicts, thirty-four 9-figure settlements, and fifteen 10-figure settlements. We have achieved success for our plaintiff clients in virtually every type of setting imaginable—including as part of class actions, as plaintiffs opting out from class actions to pursue individual claims, in group actions, and in solo actions. We have achieved success for plaintiffs in federal and state courts, in bankruptcy courts, and on appeal.</p>
       <p>Our proven ability to take high-stakes plaintiffs’ cases to trial—and to win them—also presents our adversaries with a threat they must consider from day one. This ever-present threat can often increase the settlement value of our plaintiffs’-side cases. We recently secured a 9-figure settlement for a pharmaceutical company in several contract disputes arising out of drug and device development collaboration and licensing agreements, without even having to file suit or request arbitration.</p>
       <p>For four of the last five years (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015), Law360 has recognized Pearson Spector Litt as one of the “Fearsome Foursome” of firms that in-house counsel least like to see on the other side. The award is based on approximately 300 interviews with general counsels and other legal department heads. We were the only firm in this foursome in any of those years that has a significant plaintiffs-side practice. This reputation often drives results.</p>     
        <p>Yet we are not a typical “plaintiffs’ firm.” Our lawyers practice on both sides of the “v,” giving them deep insights into how to successfully prosecute cases against corporate defendants. Our experience defending Fortune 100 companies allows us to see the big picture when representing plaintiffs—a significant edge over firms who confine their practice to representing plaintiffs. We also have the type of credibility with both defendants and defense counsel that comes uniquely from successfully practicing on the defense side. And this credibility brings great benefits to our clients that are plaintiffs.</p>
          <p>We are far larger than any other firm that does a significant amount of plaintiffs’ work , a fact that makes us uniquely suited to go head-to-head against the biggest corporations in the world. We have the resources and experience to prosecute any case, from complex technical patent cases to the world’s most sophisticated financial frauds or conspiracies that violate the antitrust laws. In some cases, we have taken on a dozen of the largest Wall Street banks at once—and secured massive recoveries. With over 720 lawyers, we are never outgunned. And with offices all over the world, we can go wherever necessary to vindicate our clients’ claims.</p>
          <p>In addition to being trial lawyers, we also offer our clients one of the leading appellate practices in the nation. Our trial and appellate lawyers collaborate to make sure we are ready to defend our victories and to overturn any adverse decisions. And we also have a roster of bankruptcy litigators, who can pursue claims in bankruptcy or take necessary steps to collect on judgments won through litigation.</p>
